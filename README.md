# Phy 225: Numerical Methods for Scientists and Engineers
Contains content for Phy 225 at Adelphi University.

Students should fork their own copy of this repository and clone it to their local machine (or work on Codespaces).

Note that exercises include ADVANCED MOVES that are more challenging and may require additional research or creativity. It is not necessary to complete all the advanced moves to get full credit on the assignment, but they are there for students who want to push themselves further.

Assignments are organized by week in the `assignments` folder. 
For week 6, students should complete `mooreslaw.ipynb` and sync it to their remote repository on GitHub.

## Topics:
- **Week 6**: Libraries, Plotting, and Curve Fitting
- **Week 7**: Linear Algebra
- **Week 8**: Numerical Integration and Differentiation
- **Week 9**: ODEs and PDEs
- **Week 10**: Random Numbers and Monte Carlo Methods

The following topics will not have assignments, but will be covered in lectures and may be relevant for your final projects or future work:
- **Week 11**: Overview of Optimization and Machine Learning
- **Week 12**: Embarassingly Parallel Problems and High Performance Computing
- **Week 13**: Introduction to Simulations
