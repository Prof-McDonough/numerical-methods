# Week 6: Libraries, Plotting, and Curve Fitting

**Due:** March 6, 2026

This week, you will practice using libraries to perform numerical analysis and plotting. You will learn how to use NumPy for numerical computations, Matplotlib for plotting, and SciPy for curve fitting. By the end of this week, you should be able to load and analyze data, create visualizations, and fit curves to data using these powerful libraries.

## Context
Moore's Law is the observation that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles approximately every two years, leading to exponential growth in computing power. A transistor is a fundamental building block of modern electronic devices, and the growth in transistor counts has been a key driver of technological advancement.
 In this assignment, you will analyze historical data on transistor counts and use curve fitting to model this growth.
