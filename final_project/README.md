This directory contains the project guidelines for the final project in Phy 225: Numerical Methods for Scientists and Engineers at Adelphi University, taught by Prof. Bryanne McDonough. The full guidelines are available in the `guidelines.md` file, which includes detailed instructions on project requirements, deliverables, grading criteria, and expectations for academic integrity. Please refer to that document for comprehensive information about the project.

Students can find inspiration for project ideas in the `project_ideas.md` file, which includes links to examples of computational physics projects available online. These examples are meant to spark creativity and provide a starting point for your own project, but you are encouraged to develop your own unique project that aligns with your interests and the course learning goals.

TODO:
- [ ] Add examples and guidelines for project proposal; [see this example from another course](https://github.com/williamgilpin/cphy/blob/main/vignettes/proposal.md).
