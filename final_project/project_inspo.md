# Phy 225 Final Project Inspiration
This file contains links to project ideas and inspiration for students in Phy 225. These examples are meant to spark creativity and provide a starting point for your own project, but you are encouraged to develop your own unique project that aligns with your interests and the course learning goals. When these resources were compiled by others, links to the original repositoriies are provided.
